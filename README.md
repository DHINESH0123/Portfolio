DHINESH SHANMUGAM - Professional Portfolio
This repository hosts the source code for the personal portfolio of DHINESH SHANMUGAM, an AI & Data Science Enthusiast and Full-Stack Developer. The website is a modern, responsive platform designed to showcase my education, professional experience, technical skills, and featured projects.

üåü Key Features
The portfolio is built with a focus on a clean, professional aesthetic and smooth user experience.

Responsive Design: Fully adaptable layout for all screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktop computers.

Monochrome Aesthetic: A striking Black & White theme provides a professional and distraction-free visual experience.

Interactive Animations:

Lift Effect: Cards and sections feature a subtle "lift" shadow effect on hover (animated-card class) to enhance interactivity.

Custom Loader: A 1.5-second custom loader animation is triggered before navigation or file downloads (e.g., resume download) to improve perceived performance.

Sticky Navbar: The navigation bar remains fixed at the top, transitioning slightly on scroll for ease of access.

Modular Sections: Dedicated sections for all key professional information:

About Me: Details on key strengths and interests.

Education & Experience: Outlines academic background (B-Tech in AI & Data Science) and internship experience (Machine Learning Engineer Intern).
